    <h2>Tart and tangy ice cream that is very refreshing in the summer!</h2>
    <p>I don't know what to say. It's an ice cream.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups heavy whipping cream</li>
        <li>1 cup half-and-half cream</li>
        <li>1⅛ cups white sugar</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons grated lemon zest</li>
        <li>5 egg yolks</li>
        <li>¾ cup fresh lemon juice</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine heavy cream, half and half, sugar, and lemon zest in a saucepan; 
            bring to a simmer over low heat. Cook and stir until sugar is dissolved, 
            about 5 minutes. Remove from heat. Cover saucepan and allow the mixture 
            to steep for 10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Uncover pan and bring back to a simmer over low heat. Beat the egg yolks 
            in a bowl. Gradually stir one cup of the hot cream mixture into the eggs, 
            several tablespoons at a time. This will help to bring the eggs up to 
            temperature without scrambling them. Stir the egg mixture back into the 
            cream mixture in the saucepan. Cook and stir over low heat until the mixture 
            just coats the back of a spoon, 5 to 10 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl; 
            cover. Refrigerate overnight.
        </li>
        <li>Stir the lemon juice into the cold ice cream mixture. Freeze in a 4 to 5 
            quart ice cream maker according to manufacturer's directions. Transfer ice 
            cream to a lidded freezer container, and freeze for 4 hours to ripen flavors 
            before serving.

    </ol>
