    <h1>Filipino-Style Barbecue Chicken</h1>

    <h2>The best barbecue chicken you've never had</h2>
    <p>I worked with Filipino cooks many years ago, and I vaguely remember them using, 
        and loving, something called banana sauce, which I thought was a type of hot sauce, 
        but apparently it's the exact same thing as banana ketchup, which is what most 
        recipes call for. I don't think I ever even tried it, but now, after making this, 
        I'm officially a big fan. So, whether you can find a bottle of ketchup at the store, 
        or you make it from scratch, I really must insist you give this incredible barbecue 
        chicken a try soon.

        <li>1 medium very ripe banana, mashed</li>
        <li>¼ cup tomato paste</li>
        <li>¼ cup apple cider vinegar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons freshly grated ginger</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon onion powder</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>For the Chicken and Marinade:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup prepared banana ketchup</li>
        <li>¾ cup lemon-lime soda (such as 7-Up®)</li>
        <li>½ cup soy sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>For the Basting Sauce:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons reserved banana ketchup</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Mash ripe banana, tomato paste, vinegar, brown sugar, oil, ginger, onion powder, 
            garlic powder, cayenne, salt, allspice, and turmeric together in a saucepan. 
            Add water and stir to combine.
        </li>
        <li>Place over medium-high heat and bring to a simmer. Stir to combine. Reduce heat 
            to medium and simmer until reduced and thickened, 7 to 10 minutes. 
            Remove from heat; reserve 3 tablespoons for the basting sauce, leaving 
            about 1/2 cup for the marinade.
        </li>
        <li>Transfer ½ cup banana ketchup to a bowl and add lemon-lime soda, soy sauce, garlic, 
            brown sugar, black pepper, and lemon juice for the marinade. Whisk until combined. 
            Add halved chicken thighs and toss to coat.
        </li>
    </ol>
